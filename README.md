Download logs from two servers and processing data

This files will download log files from two distinct servers and show final results.

In order to get this code to work, it's important to mention that previously you need to set authentication keys between your local server (local machine) and servers you want to download log files from.

Once you do that, you'll be able to edit and run scripts successfully.

Before run downloadLogs.sh, make sure to edit that file to set your correct server/logs information.
